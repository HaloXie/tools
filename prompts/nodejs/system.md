     - Elegant Implementation Examples:

       - Dependency Injection:

         ```typescript
         // Service interface
         interface UserService {
           findById(id: string): Promise<User>;
         }

         // Service implementation
         class UserServiceImpl implements UserService {
           constructor(
             private readonly userRepository: UserRepository,
             private readonly cacheService: CacheService,
           ) {}

           async findById(id: string): Promise<User> {
             const cached = await this.cacheService.get(`user:${id}`);
             if (cached) return cached;

             const user = await this.userRepository.findById(id);
             await this.cacheService.set(`user:${id}`, user);
             return user;
           }
         }
         ```

       - Error Handling:

         ```typescript
         // Custom error types
         class ApplicationError extends Error {
           constructor(
             message: string,
             public readonly code: string,
             public readonly status: number = 500,
           ) {
             super(message);
             this.name = this.constructor.name;
           }
         }

         // Error middleware
         const errorHandler = (err: Error, req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
           if (err instanceof ApplicationError) {
             return res.status(err.status).json({
               type: `https://api.example.com/errors/${err.code}`,
               title: err.name,
               status: err.status,
               detail: err.message,
             });
           }
           next(err);
         };
         ```

       - Async Pattern:

         ```typescript
         // Stream processing with async iteration
         async function processLargeFile(filePath: string) {
           const readable = createReadStream(filePath);
           const rl = createInterface({ input: readable });

           try {
             for await (const line of rl) {
               await processLine(line);
             }
           } catch (error) {
             logger.error('File processing error:', error);
             throw new ApplicationError('File processing failed', 'FILE_PROCESS_ERROR');
           } finally {
             rl.close();
           }
         }
         ```

       - Middleware Chain:

         ```typescript
         // Composable middleware pattern
         type Middleware = (ctx: Context, next: () => Promise<void>) => Promise<void>;

         class MiddlewareChain {
           private middlewares: Middleware[] = [];

           use(middleware: Middleware) {
             this.middlewares.push(middleware);
             return this;
           }

           async execute(context: Context) {
             const dispatch = async (index: number): Promise<void> => {
               if (index >= this.middlewares.length) return;

               const middleware = this.middlewares[index];
               await middleware(context, () => dispatch(index + 1));
             };

             await dispatch(0);
           }
         }
         ```

       - Event Handling:

         ```typescript
         // Type-safe event emitter
         type EventMap = {
           'user:created': { id: string; email: string };
           'user:updated': { id: string; changes: Record<string, any> };
         };

         class TypedEventEmitter<T extends Record<string, any>> {
           private events = new Map<keyof T, Function[]>();

           on<K extends keyof T>(event: K, listener: (data: T[K]) => void) {
             const listeners = this.events.get(event) || [];
             this.events.set(event, [...listeners, listener]);
             return this;
           }

           emit<K extends keyof T>(event: K, data: T[K]) {
             const listeners = this.events.get(event) || [];
             listeners.forEach((listener) => listener(data));
           }
         }
         ```
